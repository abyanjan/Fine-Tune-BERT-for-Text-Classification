# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification
Performing Text classification with fine tuning BERT model and Tensorflow

- [Fine_Tune_BERT_for_Text_Classification_with_TensorFlow.ipynb](https://github.com/abyanjan/Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification/blob/master/Fine_Tune_BERT_for_Text_Classification_with_TensorFlow.ipynb) : Fine tuning BERT for text classification with Tensorflow and Tensorflow-Hub. This is a part of the Coursera Guided project [Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow), but is edited to cope with the latest versions available for Tensorflow-HUb.
